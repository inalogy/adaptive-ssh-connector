# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-07-01
### Added
- new dynamicConfiguration.json Properties:
  - generalFatalErrorMessage: Usable if scripts throw unexpected error in CRUD operations
  - preloadScript: absolute path to the preloadScript works only in conjunction with resource configuration **'usePersistentShell'** == true
- Persistent shell functionality (Tested only on Windows):
    - by setting resource configuration **'usePersistentShell'** connector will create reusable session, in addition to this if dynamicConfiguration.json has **'preloadScript'** defined, preloadScript get executed each time new session is spawned this results in massive performance boost in Powershell Connect-Exchange, Connect-MsGraph since they're executed only once per persistent session, consecutive requests like executeQuery by id take 200-600ms. See [Exchange Online preload script guide âžœ](samples/MicrosoftExchange/Exchange-Online-Persistent-Shell:DistLists-Management/preloadScript-guide.md)
